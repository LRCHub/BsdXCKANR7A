[00:00.93] You hear that guys?
[00:03.03] Calvin Klein's gonna make the big sea dance on Saturday!
[00:06.05] Well, we wouldn't be caught dead, at a thing like that, are we guys?
[00:09.53] No! Yes!
[00:13.53] 
[00:12.39] There's somethin' about that punk that I don't trust
[00:16.90] He's dangerous
[00:18.10] There's somethin' that don't add up
[00:21.36] A rhythmic tick, and a hockey stick
[00:24.96] There's somethin' about that guy
[00:27.54] Since he appeared, it's really weird (yeah)
[00:31.24] There's somethin' that's all messed up
[00:33.75] It don't make sense how he's drеssed up
[00:53.25] 
[00:37.23] I'm gonna find him
[00:39.68] And when I do (and when you do)
[00:43.38] I'm gonna rеmind him
[00:45.80] Of what a man can't do
[00:56.80] 
[00:48.64] I'm gonna teach him a lesson
[00:51.90] That he'll always forget (never forget)
[00:55.67] Teach him for messin' with
[00:58.37] A man he won't regret (man he will regret)
[01:00.97] Yes, I'm the man he won't regret (will regret)
[01:04.88] Teach him a lesson
[01:07.53] That I haven't learnt yet
[01:10.90] Teach him for messin' with
[01:13.73] A man he will forget (man he won't)
[01:31.23] 
[01:16.21] Yes, I'm the man
[01:17.32] (You're the man)
[01:18.04] I'm the man
[01:18.84] (You're the man)
[01:19.65] I'm the man!
[01:20.51] (He'll be destroyed!)
[01:31.01] 
[01:23.27] There's somethin' about that boy
[01:26.29] It's heads, he wins
[01:27.56] And tails, I lose
[01:29.70] There's somethin' that I'll (he'll) destroy
[01:32.37] I'll pay his dues!
[01:33.75] I'll shine his shoes!
[01:44.25] 
[01:35.59] Saturday night!
